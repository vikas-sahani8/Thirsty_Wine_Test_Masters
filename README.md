# Thirsty Wine Test Masters - Automation Testing

## Project Title: Thirsty Wine

### Introduction
The **Thirsty Wine** website is a comprehensive e-commerce platform designed for wine enthusiasts to browse, search, purchase, and review a wide variety of wines. The platform includes essential features such as user registration, secure login, efficient order management, seamless payment processing, and responsive customer support.

This test plan outlines the **manual and automation testing** strategy to ensure that all functionalities operate as intended, providing a user-friendly experience and maintaining optimal performance across various devices and browsers.

## Project Type
This project incorporates both **manual and automation testing** using **Cypress**. We leverage the **Page Object Model (POM)** to structure our Cypress automation tests, enhancing maintainability and reusability. Our testing strategy covers:
- **Functionality**
- **Usability**
- **Compatibility** across multiple browsers and devices.

Additionally, we implement **BDD Cucumber** to provide clear and concise test specifications, ensuring an efficient and effective testing process.
